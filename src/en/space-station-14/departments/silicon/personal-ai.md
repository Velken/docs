# Personal AI (pAI)
<!--
`Designers` should be the names that you use on GitHub and/or Discord. This is optional but strongly recommended, since:

- This acknowledges credit where it is due
- People who are confused about the written intent can use this information to contact the authors

`Implemented` is the status of the feature.

Github links can include multiple PRs, if relevant.

## Overview

<!-- A very short, maybe three sentence summary of what this proposal is about. A high level "overview" or "what this adds". -->

This is for the ghost role pAI - which is to help answer any frequently asked questions for pAIs and to help others understand what the pAIs are about.

Personal AIs in short are helpers to their holders, and are meant to give assistant to their owner.
A pAI are not proper silicion, but a companion that acts as a sapient tool-secretary for their owner.

## Background

<!--
Summarize any information that is needed to contextualize the proposed changes, e.g. the current state of the game.

Also link any relevant discussions on Discord, GitHub, or HackMD that are relevant to the proposal.
-->

Personal AI devices are commonly found around the station. Their existance is of a silicon, they don't have laws, but are bound to help their owner.

Their general goal is to be an assistant, be it by helping remember something, yell for help or even using their abilities.

## Features to be added

<!-- Give a description of what game mechanics you would like to add or change. This should be a general overview, with enough details on critical design points that someone can directly implement the feature from this design document. Exact numbers for game balance however are not necessary, as these can be adjusted later either during development or after it has been implemented, but mention *what* will have to be balanced and what needs to be considered when doing so. -->

Personal AIs need more abilities to be purchasable, as their current options is very limited.

Some of the pAIs abilities are locked from the store if they don't have the valid corresponding access in the ID that is inserted with them in the PDA. And become unable to use said abilities while not having the required access.
For example: a pAI in a medical staff's PDA, can spend memory to buy a crew monitor. But if they are taken out of the PDA and/or put in a non-medical PDA, that ability no longer becomes usable, but they do NOT get a refund for the spent memory.


## Game Design Rationale

<!--
Consider addressing:
- How does the feature align with our [Core Design Principles](../space-station-14/core-design/design-principles.md) and game philosphy?
- What makes this feature enjoyable or rewarding for players?
- Does it introduce meaningful choices, risk vs. reward, or new strategies?
- How does it enhance player cooperation, competition, or emergent gameplay?
- If the feature is a new antagonist, how does it fit into the corresponding [design pillars](../space-station-14/round-flow/antagonists.md)?
-->
While not completely unique, since they are a smaller version of AI, is that the pAIs have access to a lot of information, but their lack of autonomy, including talking in comms directly, locks them to being assistants.
The lack of autonomy allows to give pAI some more powerful abilties, that would, otherwise, not be given to a crewmember.
Using the example from before, the crew monitor does exist as a handheld item, but is limited to 1 per station, being a highly valuable item that is even a steal tagert. But a pAI could have the ability, since it needs to relay the information to someone be able to act on it, which leaves us to a total of two players being "used" as a resource to get the same result.

### Memory modules breakdown:

The pAI starts with 30 memory avaiable to buy modules, 

#### Memory modules (Actions)

- These can be a wide variety of cost and power.
  - Categories:
    - Generic:
      - Station Map
	  - Music (basic midiplayer)
	  - Mass Scanner
      - T-Ray Scanner
    - Medical:
      - ~~Crew Monitor~~
    - Engineering:
	  - Atmospheric Alerts
    - Service:
      - Music+ (has a bunch of intrusment options)
    - Cargo:
      - Cargo Bounty (with printer, and if they have QM access, they can even skip)
	- Syndicate:

	- Science:
	  - Research and Development
	- Security:
	  - Criminal Records
	  

## Roundflow & Player interaction

<!--
Consider addressing:
- At what point in the round does the feature come into play? Does it happen every round? How does it affect the round pace?
- How do you wish for players to interact with your feature and how should they not interact with it? How is this mechanically enforced?
- Which department will interact with the feature? How does the feature fit into the [design document](../space-station-14/departments.md) for that department?

# Technical Considerations

<!--
- Are there any anticipated performance impacts?
- Does the feature require new systems, UI elements, or refactors of existing ones?
- For required UI elements, give a short description or a mockup of how they should look like (for example a radial menu, actions & alerts, navmaps, or other window types)
